# Introduction

Recently, I've been working on a project over at Nord Studio called [Miru](https://miru.nordstud.io). It's a free, open-source, self-hostable, and fully customisable status page and monitoring service
which uses Docker as the primary deployment method.

While I was testing deployment, I used a "this will do for now" approach for the Docker images and moved on to other features.
What I failed to notice was that the Docker image for Miru's web dashboard had grown to an enormous **2.19GB**!

I thought it was time to investigate, see if I could reduce the size, and share my findings with you.

## Drizzle ORM migrations

The first thing I was suspicious of was the way I was handling database migrations with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/migrations).

During development, I used the `drizzle-kit` CLI to generate SQL migration files and push them to the database using `pnpm drizzle generate` and `pnpm drizzle migrate`.

My "this will do for now" mindset lead me to adding `pnpm drizzle migrate` to the start script and adding a step to install _all_ dependencies in the `runner` stage of the Dockerfile...

```dockerfile
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy the package.json, and install dependencies for drizzle ORM
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/package.json .
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/pnpm/store pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile

# Copy the drizzle config and migrations folder
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/drizzle.config.ts .
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/lib/db/migrations ./lib/db/migrations

# Copy the Next.js app
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/public ./public

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=3000

USER nextjs

# This runs: pnpm drizzle migrate ; next start
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

Yikes! I'm not sure what I was thinking, but we live and we learn, right? (ï¿£ â–½ ï¿£\*)ã‚ž

I'll figure out a better way to handle database migrations later, but for now, I wanted to focus on reducing the size of the Docker image.

After removing all the database migration related steps, here's what the `runner` stage looks like:

```dockerfile
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy the package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/package.json .

# Copy the Next.js app
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/apps/web/public ./public

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=3000

USER nextjs

# This runs: next start
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

After rebuilding the image, the size of the Docker image dropped from **2.19GB** to **1.18GB**.
Still a bit large, but we're getting somewhere!

## Standalone builds

In the Next.js config file, there is an `output` option that allows you to specify the output format of the build.
By default, Next.js generates a `.next` folder with all the necessary files for your app but doesn't account for any dependencies the app uses.

This results with a Docker image that contains your entire `node_modules` folder, which can be quite large. This is where the `standalone` option comes in.

By setting `output: "standalone"`, Next.js performs an analysis of your application to determine which files and dependencies are required for production. The result is a trimmed down version of the `.next` directory and a minimal `node_modules` folder with only the necessary dependencies needed to run your app.

```ts
// next.config.ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
	output: "standalone",
	// ...
};

export default nextConfig;
```

We then need to change the `runner` stage to copy the standalone build files instead of the entire `.next` folder:

```dockerfile
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy the migrations folder
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/lib/db/migrations ./apps/web/lib/db/migrations

# Copy the package.json file
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/package.json .

# Copy the Next.js build files
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/.next/static ./apps/web/.next/static
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/public ./apps/web/public

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=3000

USER nextjs

CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

After building the Docker image again, I was pleased to see that the size had dropped from **1.18GB** to **256.1MB**! ðŸŽ‰

This is a significant improvement, but I still wanted to see if I could go deeper.

## Going deeper

The base image I've been using is `node:23-alpine` which despite being one of the smaller Node.js images, clocks in at **160MB** in size.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
node         23-alpine   46ab067cc8f3   5 weeks ago    160MB
```

Since all I need is a Node.js runtime and pnpm, I decided to try out using alpine as the base image instead which is only **8.17MB** in size.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG         IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
alpine       3.21        8d591b0b7dea   2 months ago   8.17MB
```

I replaced the `node:23-alpine` base image with `alpine:3.21`.

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.21 AS base
```

Removed `corepack`, and installed `nodejs` and `pnpm` directly:

```dockerfile
# Install libc6-compat, nodejs, and pnpm
RUN apk update ; apk add --no-cache libc6-compat nodejs pnpm

# Configure pnpm
ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
```

Added `nodejs` to the `runner` stage:

```dockerfile
# Install nodejs to runner
RUN apk add nodejs
```

And started the app directly with `node`:

```dockerfile
# Use node instead of pnpm
CMD ["node", "./apps/web/server.js"]
```

Rebuilding the Docker image again shows that the size dropped from **256.1MB** to a puny **187MB**!

Great! However, we don't have database migrations yet.

## Migrating during runtime

After doing some research, I found that Drizzle ORM has a built-in way to run migrations during runtime. Since this was my first time using Drizzle ORM, I wasn't aware of this feature and had been doing it the hard way the entire time.

I opted to use the `migrate` function from the `drizzle-orm` package along with the [`instrumentation`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/instrumentation) file from Next.js.

```ts
// instrumentation.ts
export async function register() {
	// Only run this code when the runtime is Node.js
	if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === "nodejs") {
		const path = await import("path");

		// Dynamically import the migrate function and db client
		const { migrate } = await import("drizzle-orm/node-postgres/migrator");
		const { db } = await import("./lib/db/index");

		// Run the migrations
		await migrate(db, {
			migrationsFolder: path.join(
				process.cwd(),
				"lib",
				"db",
				"migrations"
			),
		});
	}
}
```

The `instrumentation.ts` file exports a `register` function that is called once when a new Next.js server instance is initiated and executes for both Node.js and Edge runtimes.
Since we are only interested in running the migrations when the runtime is Node.js, we check for that using the `NEXT_RUNTIME` env variable.

We then dynamically import the `migrate` function from the `drizzle-orm` package and the `db` client from our own code.
Finally, we call the `migrate` function with the database client and the path to the migrations folder.

Now every time the app starts, it will run the migration function before accepting any requests.

Our final Dockerfile looks like this:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.21 AS base

# Install libc6-compat, nodejs, and pnpm
RUN apk update ; apk add --no-cache libc6-compat nodejs pnpm

# Configure pnpm
ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"

# Prune the web app from the monorepo
FROM base AS prune

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy entire project and prune the web app
COPY . .
RUN pnpm dlx turbo prune --scope=@miru/web --docker

# Install dependencies and build the project
FROM base AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# First install the dependencies (as they change less often)
COPY --from=prune /app/out/json/ .
COPY --from=prune /app/out/pnpm-lock.yaml ./pnpm-lock.yaml

RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Set default environment variables
ENV APP_ENV="production"
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Build the project
COPY --from=prune /app/out/full/ .
RUN pnpm dlx turbo run build --filter=@miru/web

FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Install nodejs to runner
RUN apk add nodejs

# Don't run production as root
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy the build output
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/.next/static ./apps/web/.next/static
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/public ./apps/web/public

# Copy the migrations and drizzle.config.ts file
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/apps/web/lib/db/migrations ./apps/web/lib/db/migrations

EXPOSE 3000

ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
ENV PORT=3000

USER nextjs
CMD ["node", "./apps/web/server.js"]
```

Rebuilding the image one last time reveals the size of the Docker image has increased slightly to **187.4MB**.
Going from **2.19GB** to **187.4MB** is a massive improvement, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

## Conclusion

It goes to show that when you take the time to investigate and optimize your code, you can achieve some pretty impressive results.
I hope you found this article helpful and that it inspires you to take a closer look at your own Docker images and see if there are any optimizations you can make.
